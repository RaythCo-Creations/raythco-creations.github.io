I've now created the new RaythCo website and complete with a new URL! You can access this site through [http://raythco.uk](http://raythco.uk)
<!--more-->

This site will be used for myself, and a team in the future if we form one, to release software and addons. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Minecraft Bedrock Addons
* Minecraft Bedrock Resource Packs
* Minecraft Bedrock Behaviour Packs
* Minecraft Bedrock World Downloads
* Non-minecraft related software
  * Discord Bot
  * Cubedhost Server Management Software

Hopefully over time, more stuff will be available and I hope you enjoy everything I do :)
