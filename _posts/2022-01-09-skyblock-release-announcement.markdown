Release date announced for Skyblock: Bedrock Edition
<!--more-->

After weeks of testing, I am pleased to announce that Skyblock: Bedrock Edition will be released on 1st February 2022. Once this release is complete, I will begin to populate this website with more addons and such for improving your game.

On this date, the discord server for RaythCo will also open publically, and the link will be added to the navigation menu.

Be sure to check out [**This Page**](https://raythco.uk/downloads/mcworlds/skyblockbe) for the full list of changes on the skyblock map.
