A small update to the development of the Skyblock: Bedrock edition map.
<!--more-->

Due to the fact that Minecraft 1.18 is expected to release in the next few weeks, I have delayed the release of this map to cover the fact we need to remove negative chunks from the world.
Due to this, the plan is to actually leave random negative chunks in the map but a good distance from spawn for people to use. There may also be some other hidden features related to 1.18.

Be sure to check out [**This Page**](https://raythco.uk/downloads/mcworlds/skyblockbe) for the full list of changes on the skyblock map.
