# No Maps

Maps in bedrock edition can inflate your database size massively, causing huge world size for downloads which can lead to world corruption. On single player, this is fine, but on multiplayer with everyone having map this can become unmanageable. 

This pack disables the crafting of maps on crafting table, cartography table and removes all map trades from villagers.
