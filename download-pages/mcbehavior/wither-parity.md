# Java Wither Parity

Is the bedrock wither too hard? With this pack it brings it as close to parity as possible with Minecraft: Java Edition. The wither will have just 300 health, however will not suffocate inside blocks such as bedrock.

*Note: At the present time it is not possible to disable the bedrock exclusive dash attack. When this becomes possible, I will update this pack*
