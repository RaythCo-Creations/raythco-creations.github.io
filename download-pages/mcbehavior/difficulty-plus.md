# Difficulty+

Is the normal "hard" minecraft too easy for you? Don't want to play hardcore on Java? Well today I present, Difficulty+.

This addon has 4 extra difficulty levels which can be changed in the behavior pack settings.

## Expert Level

This is the difficulty used by [Prowl8413](http://youtube.com/prowl8413) in his new **Survival Empire** series.
- Mobs do 25% more damage than vanilla minecraft (Wither/Dragon unaffected)
- Inventory disappears upon death
- Mobs have a 50% chance to spawn with enchanted armor/gear.

## Master Level

- Mobs do 50% more damage and have 50% more health. (Wither/Dragon unaffected)
- Inventory disappears upon death.
- Mobs have a 50% chance to have enchanted armor/gear.
- Insomnia is 2 nights.

## Challenger Level

- Mobs do 100% more damage and have 100% more health (Wither/Dragon unaffected)
- Inventory disappears upon death.
- Mobs have a 75% chance of spawning with enchanted armor/gear
- Insomnia is 1 night.

## Godlike Mode

This is the difficulty of my SMP server that my patrons have access to. Join the discord and sign up on patreon to join (Silver level or higher)
- Mobs do 200% more damage and have 200% more health.
- Ender dragon has 1000 health and increased damage.
- Wither has 2000 health and increased damage.
- Inventory disappears upon death.
- Mobs have a 100% chance of spawning with enchanted armor/gear
- Insomnia is ALWAYS

## Notes

Regarding mob spawning with enchanted armor/gear: Some mobs may not always spawn with armor (zombies/skeletons etc) but any gear or weapons they do spawn with will be enchanted.

When you load this pack, it will default to godlike difficulty. You can change this by clicking the cog icon under "active packs" in your world settings.
