# Daytime Monsters
With this behavior pack, monsters will spawn in the daytime. Please note: These daytime monsters are not affected by light levels so using light to block them will not work. Instead we made it so that they cannot spawn inside villages and will only spawn on the surface (Meaning your villages and underground bases are safe.)

Monsters Include:
- Zombies/Husks
- Skeletons/Strays
- Spiders
- Witches
- Creepers

## Creators
- Rayth
- GoldenHelmet
