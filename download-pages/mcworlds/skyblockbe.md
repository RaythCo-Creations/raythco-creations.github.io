**Skyblock: Bedrock Edition** is a complete remake and rebranding of Rayth Skyblock. Completely created from scratch with it's own custom addon and world generation. Containing all biomes in large multi-chunk areas, all structures so you can get structure spawns and every block available from Minecraft 1.17.

If there are any issues, or you suspect a block is missing, join the discord and let us know!
