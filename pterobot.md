Introducing PteroBot!

PteroBot is a new Discord bot that you can add to your discord server for managing your server whitelist and issue start/stop/power commands as needed. Complete with a global database of users, it can make life so much easier! Works with any minecraft server managed by the Pterodactyl management console.

### Features

* __Global User Database__
    Users only need to submit their gamertag or java in-game name to PteroBot once, on any discord server. It is then stored in a global user database where server admins can then use the whitelist command to add that user to a server.
    When a user updates their gamertag or java in-game name, whitelists are automatically updated!
* __Whitelist Management__
    Any person on your discord who is able to Ban a user from your discord server, will be able to whitelist people using the /whitelist command.
* __Server Power Management__
    Getting a lot of lag on your server? You can use the /power command to start, stop or restart your server.
